## Overview
This project is a web application that compares Spotify users' musical tastes using Node.js, React, and ChatGPT API.

## Disclaimer
Due to the high costs associated with the ChatGPT API, I have not included my personal API keys in this project. This code is provided as a template for anyone interested in developing a similar application.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
- NPM (v6.0 or higher)
- Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- OpenAI API key (for ChatGPT API access)

Ensure you have your own API keys before attempting to use this application.
