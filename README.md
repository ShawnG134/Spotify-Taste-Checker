## Motivation
Annually, Spotify released the year-end summaries. Immeidately, those triggers my curiosity about comparing the musical tastes of different users. With the release of the ChatGPT API, I saw an opportunity to delve deeper into this concept. This application extracts playlist information and top songs from users' Spotify accounts and utilizes ChatGPT to analyze and compare musical preferences. You're currently experiencing the result of this integration.


## Disclaimer
Due to the high costs associated with the ChatGPT API, I have not included my personal API keys in this project. This code is provided as a template for anyone interested in developing a similar application.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
- NPM (v6.0 or higher)
- Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- OpenAI API key (for ChatGPT API access)

Ensure you have your own API keys before attempting to use this application.
